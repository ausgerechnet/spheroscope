# formulae #
------------
## one formula
- (4) _formula_ should be made true
- (5) _formula_ could be true
- (27) _formula_ is not true (¬p)
- (35) _formula_ is a tautology
- (36) _formula_ is morally acceptable
## two formulae
- (2) _formula1_ would be reason for _formula2_ (p → q)
  + (1) _formula1_ is reason for _formula2_ (p → q; p; q)
  + (22) _formula1_ is necessary for _formula2_ (¬p → ¬q)
- (12) _formula1_ usually implies _formula2_ (p "→" q)
  + (23) _formula1_ implies _formula2_ (p → q)

# entities #
------------
## attack on entity
- (21) _entity_ is morally bad (ad-hominem catch-all)
- (20) _entity_ lies about _formula_ (since entity's beliefs contradict formula)
## entity groups
- (24) _entity_ is part of _entity group_
- (25) _entity group_ has certain _property_
- (32) _entity group_ usually have _property_
- (26) _entity_ is part of _entity group_; _entity group_ usually believes _formula_

# entities and formulae #
-------------------------
## entity → formula
- (0) _entity_ claims: _formula_ is true
- (3) _entity_ wants: _formula_ should be made true
- (10) _entity_ believes: _formula_ is true
- (34) _entity_ knows: _formula_ is true (_formula_ must be true)
- (28) _entity_ is honest about _formula_
- (16) _entity_ prefers: _formula1_ over _formula2_
- (38) _entity_ warns that _formula_ is bad
## formula → entity
- (6) _formula_ would be bad for _entity_
  + (7) _formula_ is bad for _entity_
- (8) _formula_ would be good for _entity_
  + (9) _formula_ is good for _entity_
## entities → formulas
- (33) _entity1_ claims that _entity2_ might enforce _formula_
- (37) _entity1_ wants _entity2_ to enforce _formula_

# actions #
-----------
## entity → action
- (11) _entity_ can perform: _action_
- (19) _entity_ should make _formula_ true
- (30) _entity_ executed _action_
- (31) _entity1_ can enforce _formula_ if _entity2_ executes _action_
## action → formula
- (29) _action_ would make _formula_ true

# concepts #
--------
## two concepts
- (15) _concept1_ is similar to _concept2_
