0,L_{{?0 : entity}}({?1 : formula}),entity 0 claiming that 1 is true; any kind of quotation basically,[]
1,({?0 : formula}) \mcauses ({?1 : formula}),0 is the reason why 1 is true; note that 0 and 1 could be formulas talking about the past stating that something was the reason why something was the case at some point in time,[2]
2,({?0 : formula}) \cfac ({?1 : formula}),0 would cause 1 to be true; this also covers speculations about how things could have been if past events would have gone differently,[]
3,L_{{?0 : entity}} O ({?1 : formula}),entity 0 makes a normative statement that 1 should be made true without specifying who should make 1 true,[1;4]
4,O ({?0 : formula}),0 should be made true; note that it is unspecified who should see to make 0 true; this 'should' is distinct from specifying uncertainty,[]
5,\diamond ({?0 : formula}),it is possible that 0 is true; in the sense that nothing prevents 0 from being true,[]
6,({?1 : formula}) \cfac L_{{?0 : entity}} bad,1 would be bad for entity 0,[]
7,({?1 : formula}) \mcauses L_{{?0 : entity}} bad,1 is bad for entity 0,[6]

11,A_{{?0 : entity}}({?1 : action}),entity 0 has the ability to perform action 1,[]
12,({?0 : formula}) \dimplies ({?1 : formula}),0 usually implies 1; in the sense that it might not always be the case but one can assume it is unless evidence for the contrary is presented,[]
-13,@_{{?0 : situation}}({?1 : formula}),in situation/point in time 0 1 was/is/would be the case; e.g. 'in the industrial revolution {1}'; so named points in time together with something that was or will be the case there,[]
-14,({?0 : situation}) \sim ({?1 : situation}),situations 0 and 1 are similar,[]
15,({?0 : concept}) \sim ({?1 : concept}),concepts (people or situations) 0 and 1 are similar; e.g. Hitler comparisons or comparing the brexit referendum to some other vote,[]
16,L_{{?1 : entity}}(({?0 : formula}) \leq ({?2 : formula})),entity 1 prefers 2 to be true over 0; e.g. utterances like 'xy would rather have 0 than 2',[]

-18,unqualified({?0 : entity}),entity 0 is accused of being somehow unqualified to make meaningful contributions to the dialogue; e.g. 'idiot',[]

20,L_{{?0 : entity}} ({?1 : formula}) \land \neg B_{{?0}} ({?1}),entity 0 is accused of lying about truth of 1; 0's beliefs about 1 don't reflect what 0 said about 1,[27;28]
21,\neg moral({?0 : entity}),entity 0 is morally bad and should be condemned; ad-hominem-catchall,[]
22,(\neg {?0 : formula}) \mcauses (\neg {?1 : formula}),truth of 0 is necessary for 1 to be true,[2;27]
23,({?0 : formula}) \implies ({?1 : formula}),if 0 then 1; note that if truth of 0 is said to be responsible/cause truth of 1 then it would rather be pattern 1 ,[12]
24,@_{{?0 : entity}}({?1 : entity}),entity 0 is claimed to be part of entity 1 (most likely some group),[]
25,"({?0 : entity})\implies \downarrow x.\,({?1 : formula \text{ mentioning } x})",all entities in entity 0 have property 1 e.g. brexit supporters are idiots,[]
26,"({?0 : entity})\implies \downarrow x.\,K_x ({?1 : formula}); K_{{?2 : entity}}(?1)); @_{?2} \in (?0)",entity 2 is claimed to be part of group/entity 0 whose members generally know truth of 1; e.g. as a scientist I know that this is true,[10;24;25]
27,\neg {?0 : formula},falsity of formula 0 is claimed,[]
28,L_{{?0 : entity}}({?1 : formula}) \implies K_{{?0}} ({?1}),entity 0 is claimed to be honest w.r.t. formula 1 in the sense that they say what they believe,[0;10;23]
29,[{?0 : action}]F({?1 : formula}),by executing action 0 truth of 1 would be eventually achieved,[]
30,D_{?0 : entity}({?1 : action}),entity 0 executed action 1,[]
31,[\{?0 : entity \text{ or list of } entities\};\{{?1 : action \text{ or list of } actions \text{ or list of lists of }actions}\} : {?2 : entity \text{ or list of }entities}]({?3 : formula}),the entities 0 can collaborate to enforce truth of 3 as long as entities 2 execute one of the (joint) actions from 1,[]
32,"({?0 : entity})\dimplies \downarrow x.\,({?1 : formula\text{ mentioning }x})",most entities in entity 0 have property 1 e.g. most brexit supporters are idiots,[12;25]
33,L_{{?0 : entity}} P (({?1 : formula}) \mcauses ({?2 : formula})),entity 0 claims that 1 might cause 2 to be true,[1;2;5]
34,K_{{?0 : entity}} ({?1 : formula}),entity 0 knows that 1 is true (this implies that 1 actually is true!),[]
35,\Box  ({?0 : formula}),formula 0 is necessarily true in the sense that it cannot be the case that 0 is false,[]
36,P ({?0 : formula}),formula 0 is permitted in the sense that it is morally acceptable to make 0 true or that 0 is true,[]
37,"L_{{?0 : entity}} ({?1 : entity} \implies \downarrow x.\,O_x ({?2 : formula})",entity 0 states that entities in group 1 should make 2 true,[3;25]
38,L_{{?0 : entity}} ({?1 : formula});({?1} \cfac L_{{?2 : entity}} bad),entity 0 warns of 1 being bad,[0;6]
39,"\neg(({?0 : entity} \implies \downarrow x.\,\neg {?1 : formula\text{ mentioning }x}) \lor ({0} \dimplies \downarrow x,\, {1}))",some entities in 0 have property 1,[25;27;32]
40,"\neg({?0 : entity} \implies \downarrow x.\,{?1 : formula\text{ mentioning }x})", nobody in 0 has property 1,[25;27]
