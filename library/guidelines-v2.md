# 0 Quotation
- somebody / a paper / a newspaper / ... said / says something

## change log ##
- URLs are ok

## schematic examples ##
- **ENTITY** says **FORMULA**
- according to **ENTITY**: **FORMULA**

## linguistic cues ##
- verbs of reporting (*says*, *told*)

## examples ##
- **I** told you **that this is important**
- **the #UN** says that **most of them are NOT 'refugees' at all**
- **Donald Trump is coming to the UK on June 25th** according to this **New York Times** story
- **Man** yelled '**Britain first!**'
- **Cameron** confirmed on Monday that **URL**
- **URL**: **FORMULA**

## counterexamples ##
- We talked about this in depth
  + indicates conversation and broad topic, but not what was said about it by whom
- a key Brexit supporter claims that ...
  + the entity is not specific enough

## confusions ##
- I'm like "… blurb …" (#10)

# 3 Desire #
- somebody desires something
- distinction of two types of desires: future vs. counter-factual
  + here: only desire of the future!
- negation
  + to not want = to want not (there are probably exceptions, e.g. when answering)
- opposition is a special form of desire
  - first, we annotate opposition as desire, then categorise afterwards
- the entity should be explicitly marked
  - an exception applies for ellipses (i.e. when the subject is not realised in the surface form), where the entity is the author of the message

## change log ##
- entities are ok to be desired (e.g. "**ENTITY** backs **cameron**")
- only desire directed in the future

## schematic examples ##
- **ENTITY** wants **FORMULA**

## linguistic cues ##
- verbs of desire (*want*, *wish*) of a particular outcome or event
- verbs of affiliation (*support*, *back*, *say yes to*, *to be for*)
  + as long as they're not an expression of actual activism

## examples ##
- ... says **The Times**, endorsing **Brexit**
- **George** is for **Brexit**
- Hoping for **a successful outcome**
- **I** am interested in **participating**
- **We** are really looking forward to **this**
- **they** endorse **Brexit**

## counterexamples ##
- silent majority for brexit
  + entity is undefined subset
- the pro brexit campaigners are using this strategy
  + desire defines membership
- a person supporting brexit / many people supporting brexit say ... 
  + not specified who the entities are
- he is *against* it
  + #55
- SF have issues with EU but *see it as better* for NI to remain
  + one-sided preference without explicit marking of desire
  + here: because they might not actually want to remain, despite seeing this as the rationally best decision
- democracy should be protected
  + #4
  + the 'wanter' is implicit in a non-elliptical sentence
- he *voted* remain 
  + might be interpreted as him wanting *remain* to be made true, but we do not consider such actions a sufficiently clear expression of desire
  + the desire can only be inferred from an action
- it would be nice if ..
- ... the figures were REMAIN 45% ...
  + figures do not desire anything
- you want to talk misleading?
  + rhetorical questions and idiomatic expressions
- he's got Brexit as his next agenda item
- Johnson's *reason* to remain, her *case* for leave
  + the desire can only be inferred from an expression of conscious decision or reasoning
- you seem to like that
  + positive regard without desire
- the technocrats in the EU fighting for Britain to remain
  + effort does not necessarily equal desire
- I believe in votes at 16 and no GRP for transgender people
- I'm endorsing my point from yesterday 
  + the point is being reinforced, not desired

# 24 Membership
- an entity belongs to some entity group
- for this pattern, the entity  has to have agency (e.g. people, organisations or states, but not abstract entities, objects or ideas)
  - groups are defined widely, with prototypical cases including e.g. professions, parties/organisations or nationalities
- the entity group should be determined (e.g. "these three parties")
- the entity group should also be relevant in the political discourse
  + "Brexit supporter" is reasonable group, "cowards" isn't
- statements involving properties are not group membership
  + formal distinction at the blurry line between group and attribute: when in doubt, an adjective does not designate a group even if the corresponding noun does ("**she**'s **a German**": yes, "she's German": no)

## change log ##
- only relevant groups
- we do not also annotate ad hoc groups (cf. first example)

## schematic examples ##
- **ENTITY** is part of **ENTITY GROUP**

- #24 only covers statements about group memberships that go beyond purely characterising the entity. I.e. examples will often involve an entity and a verb phrase (e.g. "**A** is a member of **B**") or a genitive construction ("**XY**'s membership in **Z**"). Group statements that only specify the entity's background (e.g. via a modifying noun phrase) are annotated as #57.

## examples ##
- **Jo** was **a politician**
- **he's** **a leaver**
- **Stuart Rose** has switched sides to **#Leave**
- **Brits** are too much **cowards** to vote (24 + 25)
- **we're** on the side of **leave**

## counterexamples ##
- **we** are all **stupid people**
- **Scotland** should remain in **EU**
- she switched sides
- Turkey's largely Muslim population
- the president is British
- he supports leave
  + #3
- a billionaire brexit supporter
  + **ENTITY** not specified
- they will stay in the EU / Ireland remains in the UK
  + *stay* or *remain* technically implies an existing membership, but in this case is read as an action rather than membership
- the UK will leave the EU
  + leaving = action resulting in end of membership rather than membership per se
- She joined the group
  + joining = action rather than membership
- we are all stupid
  + property rather than group definition
- we are all stupid people
  + not a relevant group
- Brexit will help other EU slave nations
  + group specification, but missing entity
- It is an unfortunate coincidence that this happened
  + **ENTITY** "it" has no agency
- the EU slave nations Germany and France
  + #57
- star economist Thomas Pickety
  + #57
- The Times' Jane Smith
  + #57

# 38, 41, 48, 49 Prediction of Consequence
- specialisations (explicitly good or explicitly bad consequences)
- 38 
- warning for some → prediction bad for

# 55 Opposition

# 57 
- entity + membership
- no truth value

# 58
- focus on what is desired
- no truth value
