# Guidelines v2
- we annotate argumentative patterns with slots
- the slots are realised by *formulae* or *entities*
- we use the term *concept* for referring to formulae and/or entities

## Entities
- entities are real-world objects that can be referred to
- entities can be animate or inanimate
  + a person (Anna Smith/ she)
  + a group (the Tories/ they)
  + a legal entity (Germany/ Siemens)
  + anything that can conceivably be understood as an agent
- entities have to be specific
  + indeterminate phrases such as *a key brexit supporter* or *more than half of the population* do not count as entities
  + these expressions do not reliably refer to a particular entity (*more than half* could be said without any particular members of the population being clear)
  + it is okay if *we* don't know who the entity is (e.g. in the case of pronouns: *she* said that XY counts even if we don't know who she is)
- entities can be elliptical only if it is clear that the speaker is referring to themselves, and we have syntactic ellipsis
  + "Hoping for a successful outcome!" -- read as "I am hoping for ..."

## Formulae
- a formula is any kind of statement
- formulae can be
  + declarative sentences (the UK is leaving the EU)
  + imperatives (let's brexit)
  + clauses (the UK to leave the EU)

# 0 Quotation #

## schema ##
- **ENTITY** says **FORMULA**
- according to **ENTITY**: **FORMULA**

## remarks ##
- somebody / a paper / a newspaper / ... said / says something
- the entity is defined broader here than in most other patterns: can be a poster or a website etc.

## change log ##
- URLs are ok

## linguistic cues ##
- verbs of reporting (*says*, *told*)
- quotation marks
- other references to communication: (*according to*, ENTITY *:*)

## examples ##
- **I** told you **that this is important**
- **the #UN** says that **most of them are NOT 'refugees' at all**
- **Donald Trump is coming to the UK on June 25th** according to this **New York Times** story
- **Man** yelled '**Britain first!**'
- **Cameron** confirmed on Monday that **URL**
- **URL**: **FORMULA**

## counterexamples ##
- We talked about this in depth
  + indicates conversation and broad topic, but not what was said about it by whom (talking *about* something does not specify the claims)
- a key Brexit supporter claims that ...
  + the entity is not specific enough
- I'm like "… blurb …"
  + belief (→ #10)

# 3 Desire #

## schema ##
- **ENTITY** wants **CONCEPT**

## remarks ##
- somebody desires something or wants something to happen
- distinction of two types of desires: future vs. counter-factual
  + here: only desire of the future ("I want sth to happen" vs. "I wish they hadn't done that")
- negation = opposition
  + to not want = to want not (there are probably exceptions, e.g. when answering)
  + opposition is a special form of desire
  + we thus annotate opposition as desire *and* opposition

## change log ##
- entities are ok to be desired (e.g. "**ENTITY** backs **cameron**")
- only desire directed in the future

## linguistic cues ##
- verbs of desire (*want*, *wish*, *hope*)
- verbs of affiliation (*support*, *back*, *say yes to*, *to be for*)
  + as long as they're not an expression of actual activism

## examples ##
- ... says **The Times**, endorsing **Brexit**
- **George** is for **Brexit**
- Hoping for **a successful outcome**
- **I** am interested in **participating**
- **We** are really looking forward to **this**
- **they** endorse **Brexit**

## counterexamples ##
- the pro brexit campaigners are using this strategy
  + desire defines entity (group) → #58
- silent majority for brexit
  + entity is not specific enough
- a person supporting brexit / many people supporting brexit say ... 
  + not specified who the entities are
- SF have issues with EU but *see it as better* for NI to remain
  + one-sided preference without explicit marking of desire
  + here: because they might not actually want to remain, despite seeing this as the rationally best decision
- democracy should be protected
  + the 'wanter' is implicit in a non-elliptical sentence (→ #4)
- he *voted* remain 
  + might be interpreted as him *wanting* remain to be made true, but we do not consider such actions a sufficiently clear expression of desire
  + the desire can only be inferred from an action
- it would be nice if ..
  + not clear enough for desire
- ... the figures were REMAIN 45% ...
  + figures do not desire anything
- you want to talk misleading?
  + rhetorical questions and idiomatic expressions
- he's got Brexit as his next agenda item
  + this implies what he's going to do and doesn't say anything about whether he desires it
- Johnson's *reason* to remain, her *case* for leave
  + the desire can only be inferred from an expression of conscious decision or reasoning
- you seem to like that
  + positive regard without desire
- the technocrats in the EU fighting for Britain to remain
  + effort does not necessarily equal desire
- I believe in votes at 16 and no GRP for transgender people
- I'm endorsing my point from yesterday 
  + the point is being reinforced, not desired

# 24 Membership #

## schema ##
- **ENTITY** is part of **ENTITY GROUP**

## remarks ##
- an entity belongs to some entity group
- for this pattern, the entity has to have agency (e.g. people, organisations or states, but not abstract entities, objects or ideas)
  - groups are defined widely, with prototypical cases including e.g. professions, parties/organisations or nationalities
- the entity group should be determined (e.g. "these three parties")
- the entity group should also be relevant in the political discourse
  + "Brexit supporter" is reasonable group, "cowards" isn't
- statements about somebody having properties are not group membership
  + formal distinction at the blurry line between group and attribute: when in doubt, an adjective does not designate a group even if the corresponding noun does ("**she**'s **a German**": yes, "she's German": no)
- changes in membership (join/leave) and statements of continued membership (remain/stay) are annotated as separate patterns
- this pattern only covers statements about group memberships that go beyond purely characterising the entity
  + i.e. examples will often involve an entity and a verb phrase (e.g. "**A** is a member of **B**") or a genitive construction ("**XY**'s membership in **Z**")
  + group statements that only specify the entity's background (e.g. via a modifying noun phrase - "PM Boris Johnson") are annotated as #57

## change log ##
- only groups relevant to the discourse around Brexit
- we do not annotate ad hoc groups (the Clintons are *fat cats owned by the multinationals*)

## examples ##
- **Jo** was **a politician**
- **he's** **a leaver**
- **Stuart Rose** has switched sides to **#Leave**
- **we're** on the side of **leave**

## counterexamples ##
- **we** are all **stupid people**
- **Scotland** should remain in **EU**
- she switched sides
- Turkey's largely Muslim population
- the president is British
- he supports leave
  + → #3
- a billionaire brexit supporter
  + **ENTITY** not specified
- they will stay in the EU / Ireland remains in the UK
  + → #62 continued membership
- the UK will leave the EU
  + leaving = action resulting in end of membership rather than membership per se
- She joined the group
  + joining = action rather than membership
- we are all stupid
  + property rather than group definition
- we are all stupid people
  + "stupid people" are not a relevant group
- Brexit will help other EU slave nations
  + group specification, but missing entity
- It is an unfortunate coincidence that this happened
  + **ENTITY** "it" has no agency
- the EU slave nations Germany and France
  + → #57
- star economist Thomas Pickety
  + → #57
- The Times' Jane Smith
  + → #57

# 55 Opposition #

## schema ##
- **ENTITY** is against **CONCEPT**

## remarks ##
- opposition is understood as the opposition to desire (#3)
  + **ENTITY** wants the negation of **CONCEPT**

## change log ##
- we also count negated desire here (formerly #3)
  + "**They** don't want **a Brexit**" read as "They are against a Brexit"

## examples ##
- **Junker** says no to **reform**. Germany say no tarrifs. #Brexit
- @bbclaurak to be fair if **the Almighty** came out against **#Brexit**, Leavers would say his ubiquity prevents him taking a national view. #Remain
- **Roxy** against **Brexit** watching the news nervously #DogsAgainstBrexit https://t.co/BrSp35RlnT

## counterexamples ##
- They voted against Brexit
  + voting = action (opposition too implicit)
- SCOTUS blocked the policy
  + blocking = action (see above)

# 57 Concept Refinement #

## schema ##
- **ENTITY** is part of **ENTITY GROUP**, but this is not the claim of the overall statement

## remarks ##
- typically cases where the group membership is expressed via a modifying noun phrase
- in contrast to #24 there will usually be no verb phrase expressing membership; instead, membership is considered background information about **ENTITY**

## examples ##
- the **EU slave nations** **Germany and France**
- **star economist** **Thomas Pickety**
- **The Times'** **Jane Smith** 
- **Billionaire Brexit supporter** **Max Doe** 
- **#JoeCox** **MP**

## counterexamples ##
- Germany and France are slave nations
  + → #24
- Thomas Pickety is one of the top economists
  + → #24
- this ist a statement from Lord Ashton
  + titles do not define membership
- Andrew Neil is chair of @spectator
  + entity has a specific role, their membership of the company is only implied

# 58 Desirer #

## schema ##
- group of entities desiring **CONCEPT**

## remarks ##
- typical realisations: nouns tied to desire and relative phrases
- no need for a (specific) entity

## change log ##
- As with pattern #3, groups can now desire entities and not only formulae
  + **Cameron** fans

## examples ##
- Trump is a **Brexit** supporter
  + #24 + #58
- **Stay** fans are right
- People who want **Brexit** keep saying that
- I'm **Brexit**/**Brexin**/**remain**/**leave**
- **Brexit** supporters are stupid

## counterexamples ##
- Trump supports Brexit
  + #3
- I want to stay
  + #3

# 63 Prediction of Consequence

## schema ##
- **ENTITY** predicts **FORMULA**

## remarks ##
- this pattern is a certain form of quotation
- further categorisation of formula (explicitly good or explicitly bad consequences):
  + **FORMULA1** is bad (→ #38)
  + **FORMULA1** will lead to **FORMULA2**, which is bad (→ #41)
  + **FORMULA1** is bad for **CONCEPT** (→ #48)
  + **FORMULA1** will lead to **FORMULA2**, which is bad for **CONCEPT** (→ #49)

## change log ##
- this is a super-pattern of patterns 38, 41, 48, 49, which includes warning

## linguistic cues ##
- verbs of communication (say, tell, warn, point out) + verbs indicating temporal or causal consequences (will, could, would) within the formula

## examples ##
- **Brexit will batter the comedy industry**, says **Stephen Grant**
- **Brexit would hit poor hardest**, says **David Cameron**
- **Hilary Benn** has warned that **Britain 's exit from the EU would make the country 'poorer' and 'less influential'**
- **Brexit could lead to downgrades for other EU countries** - **Fitch**
- **Richard Haass** claims that **Brexit could 'trigger NI violence'**
- **Experts** warn that **brexit could cause the pound to fall**
